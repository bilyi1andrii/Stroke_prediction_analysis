# Research Project: Stroke Prediction

## Overview
For our research project, we used an open-source dataset from the Kaggle platform. The dataset is available at the following link: Stroke Prediction Dataset. The dataset is intended for educational purposes. The data table contains a small amount of null values and includes 11 columns of attributes.

## Goal
The primary goal of our project is to investigate the main sources of strokes. Specifically, we aim to:
- Check if the data follows one of the standard distributions (gamma, normal, uniform...).
- Plot linear relationships between two or more characteristics.
- Clean the dataset by handling missing values (N/Aâ€™s).
- Calculate the average age of stroke occurrences.
- Prove that strokes at an early age (below 18) are shifted left on the age distribution curve and are likely dependent on genetic defects.
- Formulate hypotheses and perform logistic regression analysis.

## Possible Hypothesis to be Tested
1. The proportion of strokes in urban ares is equal to the proprotion of strokes in rural areas;
2. The mean avg_glucose_level for stroke patients is equal to that of non-stroke patients;
3. The proportion of strokes is the same for males and females
4. The variance in avg_glucose_level differs significantly between patients who had a stroke and whose who did not

## Results
The thorough analysis can be found in the .html file. The code part is located in .rmd file. You can also take a look at the data, which is in Dataset folder.
